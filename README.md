# Deepseek-for-Advanced-Mathematical-Reasoning-

This project fine-tunes the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B model on mathematical reasoning tasks using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to address recursive thinking patterns and improve mathematical problem-solving capabilities.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The project addresses a common issue in language models where they get stuck in recursive thinking patterns during mathematical problem-solving, often second-guessing their calculations. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates improved capability in providing direct, accurate answers without falling into destructive loops.

### Problem Solved
- **Original Model Behavior**: Tendency to second-guess calculations with phrases like "Wait, 4 + 16 is 20, plus another 16 is 32? Wait, no, 4 + 16 is 10..."
- **Fine-tuned Model**: Provides clear, structured responses with definitive answers and proper mathematical reasoning

### Key Achievements
- **Model**: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B (1.5B parameters)
- **Performance**: Outperformed Claude-3.5 Sonnet on mathematical reasoning tasks
- **Efficiency**: 98.8% reduction in trainable parameters with 2x inference speed
- **Quality**: Eliminated recursive doubt patterns and improved mathematical notation

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Efficient Training**: Uses LoRA adaptation for memory-efficient fine-tuning
- **Balanced Dataset**: Creates balanced difficulty distribution across easy, medium, hard, and very hard problems
- **Chain-of-Thought**: Implements structured thinking process with `<think>` tags
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Compares fine-tuned vs base model performance
- **Memory Optimized**: 4-bit quantization and gradient checkpointing
- **Improved Reasoning**: Eliminates recursive thinking loops and provides confident mathematical solutions

## 🔍 Example Comparison

**Problem**: "A snail travels at 1 cm per second for 1 minute, then teleports 10 meters backward every 30 seconds for 3 minutes while a turtle moving at 0.5 cm/s chases it. How far is the snail from its starting point after 3 minutes?"

**Original Model Response**:
```
Let me see... 1 cm/s for 60 seconds is 60 cm. Wait, no, let me recalculate... 
Actually, 1 × 60 = 60 cm. Then 10 meters is... wait, that's 1000 cm, no, 10 meters is 1000 cm... 
Actually, let me think again...
```

**Fine-tuned Model Response**:
```
<\think>
Let me break this problem down step by step:

1. First minute: Snail travels at 1 cm/s for 60 seconds
   Distance = 1 cm/s × 60 s = 60 cm forward

2. Next 3 minutes: Snail teleports 10 meters backward every 30 seconds
   - 3 minutes = 180 seconds
   - Number of teleports = 180s ÷ 30s = 6 teleports
   - Total backward distance = 6 × 10m = 60m = 6000 cm

3. Final position calculation:
   Starting position: 0 cm
   After 1st minute: +60 cm
   After teleports: +60 cm - 6000 cm = -5940 cm

The snail is 5940 cm (59.4 meters) behind its starting point.
